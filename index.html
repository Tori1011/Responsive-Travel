        <p>The Hawaiian flag's eight horizontal stripes are said to represent the eight main Hawaiian Islands. 
          The flag's red stripes are said to symbolize Hawaii gods, while the white represents truth, and the blue signifies the ocean. 
          The Hawaiian flag originally represented the Kingdom of Hawaii.</p>

        <p>Hawaiian Ocean View Estates is located on the southern side of the Big Island in the district of Ka’u. 
          It is deemed the “World’s Largest Subdivision” with over 10,500 1-acre lots and over 150 miles of paved roads, yet it seems so small. 
          It is a very diverse subdivision. Elevation ranges from about 1,500 ft. up to 5,000 ft., making for spectacular sunrises, sunsets, and star gazing for miles. 
          The terrain varies from rugged lava fields to Ohia trees, ferns and other vegetation.</p>

      <p>The opening of The Royal Hawaiian on February 1, 1927, ushered in a new era of luxurious resort travel to Hawaii. 
        The resort was built with a price tag of $4 million, and was completed in 18 months. 
        The six-story, 400 room structure was fashioned in a Spanish Moorish style, popular during the period and influenced by screen star Rudolph Valentino. 
        The first general manager of the hotel, Arthur Benaglia, presided over a staff of 300, including ten elevator operators and lobby boys dressed in “Cathayan” costume. 
        At the grand opening’s black tie gala celebration, members of the Honolulu Symphony entertained over 1,200 guests at the $10 a plate event of the year.
        The Honolulu Star Bulletin described the newly opened Royal Hawaiian as the first resort hostelry in America.</p>
